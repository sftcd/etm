<abstract>
<t>We argue that an expanded threat model is needed for Internet protocol development
as protocol endpoints can no longer be considered to be generally trustworthy
for any general definition of &quot;trustworthy.&quot;
</t>
<t>This draft will be a submission to the DEDR IAB workshop.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>[[There's a github repo for this -- issues and PRs are welcome there.
<eref target="https://github.com/sftcd/etm"/> ]]
</t>
<t><xref target="RFC3552"/>, Section 3 defines an &quot;Internet Threat Model&quot; which has been
commonly used when developing Internet protocols.  That assumes that &quot;the
end-systems engaging in a protocol exchange have not themselves been
compromised.&quot; RFC 3552 is a formal part of of the IETF's process as it is also
BCP72.
</t>
<t>Since RFC 3552 was written, we have seen a greater emphasis on considering
privacy and <xref target="RFC6973"/> provides privacy guidance for protocol developers. RFC
6973 is not a formal BCP, but appears to have been useful for protocol
developers as it is referenced by 38 later RFCs at the time of
<eref target="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6973/referencedby/">writing</eref>.
</t>
<t>BCP188, <xref target="RFC7258"/> subsequently recognised pervasive monitoring as a
particular kind of attack and has also been relatively widely referenced (39
RFCs at the time of
<eref target="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7258/referencedby/">writing</eref>). To date,
perhaps most documents referencing BCP188 have considered state-level or
in-network adversaries.
</t>
<t>In this document, we argue that we need to epxand our threat model to
acknowledge that today many applications are themselves rightly considered
potential adversaries for at least some relevant actors. However, those (good)
actors cannot in general refuse to communicate and will with non-negligible
probability encounter applications that are adversarial.
</t>
<t>We also argue that not recognising this reality causes Internet protocol
designs to sometimes fail to protect the systems and users who depend on those.
</t>
<t>Discussion related to expanding our concept of threat-model ought not (but
perhaps inevitably will) involve discussion of weakening how confidentiality is
provided in Internet protocols. Whilst it may superficially seem to be the case
that encouraging in-network interception could help with detection of
adversarial application behaviours, such a position is clearly mistaken once
one notes that adding middleboxes that can themselves be adversarial cannot be
a solution to the problem of possibly encountering adversarial code on the
network.  It is also the case that the IETF has rough consensus to provide
better, and not weaker, security and privacy, which includes confidentiality
services. The IETF has maintained that consensus
over three decades, despite repeated (and repetitive;-) debates on the topic.
That consensus is represented in <xref target="RFC2804"/>, BCP 200 <xref target="RFC1984"/> and more
latterly, the above-mentioned BCP 188 as well as in the numerous RFCs
referencing those works.  The probability that discussion of expanding our
threat model leads to a change in that rough consensus seems highly remote.
</t>
<t>However, it is not clear if the IETF will reach rough consensus on a
description of such an expanded threat model. We argue that
ignoring this aspect of deployed reality may not bode well for Internet
protocol development.
</t>
<t>Absent such an expanded threat model, we expect to see more of a mismatch
between expectaions and the deployment reality for some Internet protocols.
</t>
<t>This internet-draft is a submission to the IAB's DEDR
<eref target="https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/dedr-workshop/">workshop</eref> and is not
intended to become an RFC.
</t>
<t>We note that another author has independently proposed changes to the Internet threat
model for related, but different, reasons, <xref target="I-D.arkko-arch-internet-threat-model"/>
also as a submission to the DEDR workshop.
</t>
<t>We are saddened by, and apologise for, the somewhat dystopian impression that
this document may impart - hopefully, there's a bit of hope at the end;-)
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="examples-of-deliberate-adversarial-behaviour-in-applications" title="Examples of deliberate adversarial behaviour in applications">
<t>In this section we describe a few documented examples of deliberate adversarial
behaviour by applications that could affect Internet protocol development.  The
adversarial behaviours described below involve various kinds of attack, varying
from simple fraud, to credential theft, surveillance and contributing to DDoS
attacks.  This is not intended to be a comprehensive nor complete survey, but
to motivate us to consider deliberate adversarial behaviour by applications.
</t>
<t>While we have these examples of deliberate adversarial
behaviour, there are also many examples of application developers doing their
best to protect the security and privacy of their users or customers. That's
just the same as the case today where we need to consider in-network actors
as potential adversaries despite the many examples of network operators who
do act primarily in the best interests of their users. So this section is
not intended as a slur on all or some application developers.
</t>

<section anchor="malware-in-curated-application-stores" title="Malware in curated application stores">
<t>Despite the best efforts of curators, so-called App-Stores frequently
distribute malware of many kinds and one recent study <xref target="curated"/>
claims that simple obfuscation enables malware to avoid detection by
even sophisticated operators. Given the
scale of these deployments, ditribution of even a small percentage of malware-infected
applictions can affect a huge number of people.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="virtual-private-networks-vpns" title="Virtual private networks (VPNs)">
<t>Virtual private networks (VPNs) are supposed to hide user traffic to various
degrees depending on the particular technology chosen by the VPN provider.
However, not all VPNs do what they say, some for example misrepresenting the
countries in which they provide vantage points. <xref target="vpns"/>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="compromised-home-networks" title="Compromised (home) networks">
<t>What we normally might consider network devices such as home routers do also run
applications that can end up being adversarial, for example running DNS and DHCP
attacks from home routers targeting other devices in the home. One study [home]
reports on a 2011 attack that affected 4.5 million DSL modems in Brazil.  The
absence of software update <xref target="RFC8240"/> has been a major cause of these issues
and rises to the level that considering this as intentional behaviour by
device vendors who have chosen this path is warranted.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="web-browsers" title="Web browsers">
<t>Tracking of users in order to support advertising based business models is
ubiquitous on the Internet today.  HTTP header fields (such as cookies) are
commonly used for such tracking, as are structures within the content of HTTP
responses such as links to 1x1 pixel images and (ab)use of Javascript APIs
offered by browsers. <xref target="tracking"/>
</t>
<t>While some people may be sanguine about this kind of tracking, others consider
this behaviour unwelcome, when or if they are informed that it happens,
<xref target="attitude"/> though the evidence here seems somewhat harder to interpret and many
studies (that we have found to date) involve small numbers of users.
Historically, browsers have not made this kind of tracking visible and have
enabled it by default, though some recent browser versions are starting to
enable visibility and blocking of some kinds of tracking. Browsers are also increasingly
imposing more stringent requirements on plug-ins for varied security reasons.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="web-site-policy-deception" title="Web site policy deception">
<t>Many web sites today provide some form of privacy policy and terms of service,
that are known to be mostly unread. <xref target="unread"/> This implies that, legal fiction
aside, users of those sites have not in reality agreed to the specific terms
published and so users are therefore highly exposed to being exploited by web
sites, for example <xref target="cambridge"/> is a recent well-publicised case where a
service provider abused the data of 87 million users via a partnership.  While
many web site operators claim that they care deeply about privacy, it seems
prudent to assume that some (or most?) do not in fact care about user privacy,
or at least not in ways with which many of their users would agree. And of
course, today's web sites are actually mostly fairly complex web applications
and are no longer static sets of HTML files, so calling these &quot;web sites&quot; is
perhaps a misnomer, but considered as web applications, that may for
example link in advertising networks, it seems clear that
many exist that are adversarial.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="tracking-bugs-in-mail" title="Tracking bugs in mail">
<t>Some mail user agents (MUAs) render HTML content by default (with a subset not
allowing that to be turned off, perhaps particularly on mobile devices) and
thus enable the same kind of adversarial tracking seen on the web. Attempts at
such intentional tracking are also seen many times per day by email users - in
one study <xref target="mailbug"/> the authors estimated that 62% of leakage to third
parties was intentional, for example if leaked data included a hash of the
recipient email address.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="troll-farms-in-online-social-networks" title="Troll farms in online social networks">
<t>Online social network applications/platforms are well-known to be vulnerable to
troll farms, sometimes with tragic
<eref target="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-twitter.html">consequences,</eref>
where organised/paid sets of users deliberately abuse the application platform
for reasons invisible to a normal user.  For-profit companies building online
social networks are well aware that subsets of their &quot;normal&quot; users are
anything but.  In one US study, <xref target="troll"/> sets of troll accounts were roughly
equally distributed on both sides of a controversial discussion. While Internet
protocol designers do sometimes consider sybil attacks <xref target="sybil"/>, arguably we
have not provided mechanisms to handle such attacks sufficiently well,
especially when they occur within walled-gardens. Equally, one can make the
case that some online social networks, at some points in their evolution,
appear to have prioritised counts of active users so highly that they have
failed to invest sufficient effort for detection of such troll farms.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="smart-televisions" title="Smart televisions">
<t>There have been examples of so-called &quot;smart&quot; televisions spying on their
owners <eref target="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/11/22/lg-admits-that-its-smart-tvs-have-been-watching-users-and-transmitting-data-without-consent/">without permission</eref>
and one survey of user attitudes <xref target="smarttv"/> found &quot;broad agreement was that it
is unacceptable for the data to be repurposed or shared&quot; although the level of
user understanding may be questionable.  What is clear though is that such
devices generally have not provided controls for their owners that would allow
them to meaningfully make a decision as to whether or not they want to share
such data.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="socalled-internet-of-things" title="So-called Internet of things">
<t>Many so-called Internet of Things (IoT) devices (&quot;so-called&quot; as all devices
were already things:-) have been found extremely deficient when their security
and privacy aspects were analysed, for example children's toys. <xref target="toys"/> While
in some cases this may be due to incompetence rather than being deliberately
adversarial behaviour, the levels of incompetence frequently seen imply that it
is valid to consider such cases as not being accidental.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="inadvertent-adversarial-behaviours" title="Inadvertent adversarial behaviours">
<t>Not all adversarial behaviour by applications is deliberate, some is likely due
to various levels of carelessness (some quite understandable, others not)
and/or due to erroneous assumptions about the environments in which those
applications (now) run.
<vspace/>
We very briefly list some such cases:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Application abuse for command and control, for example, use of IRC or apache
logs for <eref target="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/100577/creating-botnet-cc-server-what-architecture-should-i-use-irc-http">malware command and

<t>Carelessly <eref target="https://businessinsights.bitdefender.com/worst-amazon-breaches">leaky

example, lots of Amazon S3 leaks showing that careless admins can too easily

<t>Virtualisation exposing secrets, for example, <eref target="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-004A">Meltdown and
Spectre</eref> and similar
side-channels</t>
<t>Compromised badly-maintained web sites, that for example, have led to massive
online <eref target="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">databases of passwords</eref></t>
<t>Supply-chain attacks, for example, the <eref target="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-hackers-stole-millions-of-credit-card-records-from-target/">Target

<t>Breaches of major service providers, that many of us might have assumed would
be sufficiently capable to be the best large-scale &quot;Identity providers&quot;, for

</section>

<section anchor="possible-directions-for-an-expanded-threat-model" title="Possible directions for an expanded threat model">
<t>As we believe useful conclusions in this space require community consensus,
we won't offer definitive descriptions of an expanded threat model
but we will call out some potential directions that could be explored at the
DEDR workshop and thereafter, if there is interest in this topic.
</t>

<section anchor="develop-a-bcp-for-privacy-considerations" title="Develop a BCP for privacy considerations">
<t>It may be time for the IETF to develop a BCP for privacy
considerations, possibly starting from <xref target="RFC6973"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="consider-the-user-perspective" title="Consider the user perspective">
<t><xref target="I-D.nottingham-for-the-users"/> argues that, in relevant cases where there are
conflicting requirements, the &quot;IETF considers end users as its highest priority
concern.&quot; Doing so seems consistent with the expanded threat model being argued
for here, so may indicate that a BCP in that space could also be useful.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="consider-abusecases-as-well-as-usecases" title="Consider ABuse-cases as well as use-cases">
<t>Protocol developers and those implementing and deploying Internet technologies
are typically most interested in a few specific use-cases for which they need
solutions. Expanding our threat model to include adversarial application
behaviours <xref target="abusecases"/> seems likely to call for significant attention to be
paid to potential abuses of whatever new or re-purposed technology is being
considered.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="reconsider-protocol-design-lore" title="Re-consider protocol design &quot;lore&quot;">
<t>It could be that this discussion demonstrates that it is timely to reconsider
some protocol design &quot;lore&quot; as for example is done in
<xref target="I-D.iab-protocol-maintenance"/>. More specifically, protocol extensibility
mechanisms may inadvertently create vectors for abuse-cases, given that
designers cannot fully analyse their impact at the time a new protocol is
defined or standardised. One might conclude that a lack of extensibility could
be a virtue for some new protocols, in contrast to earlier assumptions.
As pointed out by one commenter though, people can find ways to extend
things regardless, if they feel the need.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="isolation" title="Isolation">
<t>Sophisticated users can sometimes deal with adversarial behaviours in applications
by using different instances of those applications, for example, differently
configured web browsers for use in different contexts.  Applications (including
web browsers) and operating systems are also building in isolation via use of
different processes or sandboxing.  Protocol artefacts that relate to uses of
such isolation mechanisms might be worth considering.  To an extent, the IETF
has in practice already recognised some of these issues as being in-scope, e.g.
when considering the linkability issues with mechanisms such as TLS session
tickets, or QUIC connection identifiers.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="transparency" title="Transparency">
<t>Certificate transparency (CT) <xref target="RFC6962"/> has been an effective countermeasure
for X.509 certificate mis-issuance, which used be a known application layer
misbehaviour in the public web PKI. While the context in which CT operates is
very constrained (essentially to the public CAs trusted by web browsers),
similar approaches could be useful for other protocols or technologies.
</t>
<t>In addition, legislative requirements such as those imposed by the GDPR for
<eref target="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/">subject access to data</eref> could lead to a
desire to handle internal data structures and databases in ways that are
reminiscent of CT, though clearly with significant authorisation being required
and without the append-only nature of a CT log.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="minimise" title="Minimise">
<t>As recommended in <xref target="RFC6973"/> data minimisation and additional encryption are
likely to be helpful - if applications don't ever see data, or a cleartext form
of data, then they should have a harder time misbehaving. Similarly, not adding
new long-term identifiers, and not exposing existing ones, would seem helpful.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sameorigin-policy" title="Same-Origin Policy">
<t>The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) <xref target="RFC6454"/> perhaps already provides an example of
how going beyond the RFC 3552 threat model can be useful. Arguably, the
existence of the SOP demonstrates that at least web browsers already consider
the 3552 model as being too limited. (Clearly, differentiating between
same and not-same origins implicitly assumes that some origins are not
as trustworthy as others.)
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="greasing" title="Greasing">
<t>The TLS protocol <xref target="RFC8446"/> now supports the use of GREASE <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-grease"/>
as a way to mitigate on-path ossification. While this technique is not likely
to prevent any deliberate misbehaviours, it may provide a proof-of-concept that
network protocol mechanisms can have impact in this space, if we spend the time
to try analyse the incentives of the various parties.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="conclusions" title="Conclusions">
<t>At this stage we don't think it approriate to claim that any strong conclusion
can be reached based on the above. We do however, claim that the is a topic
that could be worth discussion at the DEDR workshop and elsewhere.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>This draft is all about security, and privacy.
</t>
<t>Encryption is one of the most effective tools in countering network based
attackers and will also have a role in protecting against adversarial
applications. However, today many existing tools for countering adversarial
applications assume they can inspect network traffic to or from potentially
adversarial applications. These facts of course cause tensions (e.g. see
<xref target="RFC8404"/>).  Expanding our threat model could possibly help reduce some of
those tensions, if it leads to the development of protocols that make
exploitation harder or more transparent for adversarial applications.
